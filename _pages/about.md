I obtained my PhD from the University of Washington.
My advisor was Dr. <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/" >Mari Ostendorf</a>. I also worked closely with <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/"> Noah A. Smith</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hcheng2site/Home">Hao Cheng</a> during my PhD study. 
My research interests focus on dialogue systems and model inference efficiency.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!

⭐ **I am currently seeking research scientist/engineer opportunities.** ⭐
