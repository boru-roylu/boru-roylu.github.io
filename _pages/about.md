I am a fifth-year PhD student in <a href="http://tial-uw.github.io/">Transformation, Interpretation, and Analysis of Language (TIAL) lab</a> and <a href="https://nlp.washington.edu/">Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group</a> at the University of Washington. My advisor is Dr. <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/" >Mari Ostendorf</a>. My research interests focus on deep learning and its applications on conversational natural language.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!
