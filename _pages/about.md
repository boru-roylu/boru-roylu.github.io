I earned my PhD from the University of Washington, where I was advised by <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/">Dr. Mari Ostendorf</a>. 
During my doctoral studies, I also collaborated closely with <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah A. Smith</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hcheng2site/Home">Hao Cheng</a>. 
My research primarily focuses on dialogue systems and enhancing model inference efficiency.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!
